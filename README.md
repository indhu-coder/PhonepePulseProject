Digitalisation of payments is a global trend, with the COVID-19 pandemic having triggered accelerated adoption. While India has been at the forefront of this transition, there is little understanding of how the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), Indiaâ€™s real-time digital payment system, has diffused and the extent of its inclusive scaling within the country. 

Phonepe is India's leading fintech platform, where Digital India is making progress by reducing the usage of money in physical form.Licensed under the CDLA-Permissive-2.0 open data license, the PhonePe Pulse Dataset API is a first of its kind open data initiative in the payments space.
PhonePe Pulse is India's first interactive website with data, insights and trends on digital payments in the country.This project relies on state and district level data from PhonePe, to better understand the heterogeneity in patterns of diffusion across states and districts of India.
